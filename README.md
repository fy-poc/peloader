This project is a simple Portable Executable (PE) Loader that demonstrates my skills in handling binary structures, specifically focusing on Import Address Table (IAT) and relocation table. 
There are many similar projects available, but this one showcases my ability to manipulate and understand the internal workings of PE file formats, achieved through in-depth search and analysis. 

Key Features 
-	IAT Parsing : The loader identifies and processes the Import Address Table, which responsible for resolving external dependencies. 
-	Relocation Handling: Properly processes the relocation table, ensuring the PE is loaded correctly into memory, even if the preferred base address isnâ€™t available. 
Why I Built This 
The promaru goal of this project is to demonstrates my expertise in binary structures and low-level systems programming. Tis project highlights my understanding of PE file formats, essential for reveres engineering, system programming, and malware analysis.
